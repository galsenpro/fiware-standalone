## Introduction

The Spy Wiring widget is a WireCloud widget that provides an easy way to inspect the data that travels trough the wiring.

## Wiring

### Input Endpoints

- `Input`: The data to be analyzed.

### Output Endpoints

- `Output`: The endpoint where the received data and new events will be sent.

## Settings

- `Start recording`: Whether the widget starts on recording or playing mode.

## Usage

Plug in the output endpoint you want to spy and it will be displayed on the widget.
If the record mode is activated, data won't be sent forward until the step or run buttons are pressed. While on this mode, data can be edited and the modified data will be sent instead.

The output data will be sent with the type defined by the type selector.
