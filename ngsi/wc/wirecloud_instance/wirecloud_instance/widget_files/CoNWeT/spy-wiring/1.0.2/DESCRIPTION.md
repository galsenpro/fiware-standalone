This widget allows you to inspect data traveling trough the wiring. Moreover,
you will be able to pause the events, decide if you want to drop some events and
make some modifications on those events.

Evidently, the main use of this widget is being able to debug the wiring of the
widgets/operators deployed on your workspace. See the [Application Mashup GE
(Wirecloud) course at the FIWARE Academy][wirecloud-course] for more info and
tutorials about how to develop widgets and operators.
