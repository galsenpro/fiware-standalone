============

The NGSI Browser widget allows you to browser [Orion Context
Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker)
servers in a easy and paginated way. This is done using the `queryContext`, so
updates made into the context broker are not reflected immediately when using
this widget.

> Lab](https://store.lab.fiware.org/search/keyword/OrionStarterKit) where you
> can make use of it on the [Mashup portal](https://mashup.lab.fiware.org).
