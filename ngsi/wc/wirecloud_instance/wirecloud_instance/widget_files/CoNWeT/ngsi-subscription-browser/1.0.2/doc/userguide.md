## Introduction

The NGSI Subscription Browser widgets allows you to browser the subscriptions
managed by a given [Orion Context
Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker)
server in a easy and paginated way. This is accomplished using GET querys to the
v2 of the Context Broker API, so updates made into the context broker are not
reflected immediately when using this widget.

> Latest version of this widget is always provided in [FIWARE
> Lab](https://store.lab.fiware.org/search/keyword/OrionStarterKit) where you
> can make use of it on the [Mashup portal](https://mashup.lab.fiware.org).
> Remember to take a look into the example mashups provided in the
> OrionStarterKit offering.
